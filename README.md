# Algorithm-for-Admissible-Pairs

Algorithm I.py file is used to check the first 10000 positive integers, and Algorithm II.py is used to finish the proof of Theorem 1.3. We use two distinct approaches here because of the cost of running time for large integers of size >> 10^6. Algorithm II will proceed much faster than Algorithm I.
